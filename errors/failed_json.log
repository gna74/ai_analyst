  "name": "laser weapon",
  "definition": "A laser weapon is a directed-energy weapon system that employs high-energy laser beams to damage or destroy targets. It operates by focusing coherent electromagnetic radiation onto a specific point, generating intense thermal effects. Unlike kinetic weapons, it delivers energy at the speed of light without physical projectiles.",
  "method": "Laser weapons generate coherent light through stimulated emission in a gain medium, typically using chemical, solid-state, or fiber laser technologies. The beam is then amplified and directed through optical systems including mirrors and lenses to focus energy onto the target. Target acquisition and tracking systems maintain beam alignment on moving objects. The concentrated thermal energy causes rapid heating, leading to material ablation, structural failure, or system disruption depending on the target composition and laser parameters.",
